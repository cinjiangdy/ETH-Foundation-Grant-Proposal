# Project Abstract

As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and globalised, the ability to move money efficiently, economically and securely is more important than ever. The current process of moving money internationally has high fees and long processing times, making payments outdated and inefficient. Blockchain technology seeks to tackle these issues, making payments almost instantaneously without intermediaries or regulatory approval. The rise of CBDCs will also help to ease cross-border payments, they have already been successful in some cases, and we hope to analyse these cases in our research.

This project was inspired by the Academic Grant’s Wishlist, under the Humanities section, regarding how international law may be relevant to Blockchain.

# Objectives

Our proposed research topic will explore new solutions and technology that have been developed to improve cross-border payments, including blockchain solutions, distributed-ledger technology, central bank digital currencies, and other emerging technologies. By conducting in-depth quantitative & qualitative research, we hope to identify key strengths and weaknesses in the ability of new technologies.

We will look at the current cases where CBDCs, DLT, and blockchain technology are being used and find recommendations for improvements. For example, we can analyse the effectiveness of China's e-CNY Central Bank Digital Currency, the digital yuan. We will also assess the current market potential for improving cross-border payments, analyse what is currently available, and what technologies are in development. As a result of this research, I hope to devise a plan for improving cross-border payments.

# Outcomes

The potential impact of this research is significant. Improving cross-border payments can support economic growth, facilitate international trade, and enhance financial inclusion. By cutting down costs and increasing the efficiency of cross-border payments, people can send money home to families abroad, make their lives more affordable and have endless benefits. Our findings and recommendations will be valuable to various stakeholders, including policymakers, financial institutions, and the general public.

By exploring the challenges and inefficiencies associated with traditional cross-border payment systems, we can identify areas where Ethereum and other blockchain technologies could be applied to create more efficient and cost-effective solutions.

The research findings and recommendations can help inform the development of new applications and tools that leverage Ethereum's capabilities to improve cross-border payments.

The project will help to raise awareness of Ethereum and blockchain technology, in general, among stakeholders in the cross-border payments space. By demonstrating the potential benefits of blockchain-based solutions, we can help promote the adoption of Ethereum and other blockchain technologies to improve cross-border payments. The project will contribute to the ongoing development of the Ethereum ecosystem by highlighting new use cases and applications for the technology. As more organisations and individuals begin to recognises the potential benefits of Ethereum for cross-border payments, we can expect to see increased investment and innovation in this area, which will help to further grow and strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem as a whole.

Looking towards the future:

- CBDCs would enable faster, cheaper and more convenient transactions.
- CBDCs may also eliminate the need for physical cash and reduce the need for intermediaries like banks and payment processors.
- CBDCs can enable greater financial inclusion for those who are unbanked.
- CBDCs will help central banks more effectively administer monetary policy by providing greater visibility to the flow of money, allowing for more timely adjustments to interest rates and money supply.
- CBDCs offer greater privacy and security compared to traditional payment methods.

Those are the potential benefits of CBDCs; however, in our report, we will also examine their shortcomings. For example:

- Due to greater visibility into financial transactions of individuals and businesses, have CBDCs increased government surveillance and hindered our privacy?
- Are CBDCs vulnerable to cyber-attacks, exposing their users' personal and financial data?
- Do CBDCs present operational risks for banks, financial institutions and those using them?
- Is the regulatory framework in place for CBDCs to prosper?

Such questions will all be answered in our report.
